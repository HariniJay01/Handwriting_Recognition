# Handwriting_Recognition
## Using Deep learning with tf.keras
Deep learning is a subpart of machine learning and artificial intelligence which is also known as deep neural network this networks capable of learning unsupervised from provided data which is unorganized or unlabeled. today, we will implement a neural network in TensorFlow to classify handwritten digit.
### Modules required :
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Keras
### Steps to follow
Step 1 : Importing all dependence 
Step 2 : Import data and normalize it 
Step 3 : view data 
Step 4 : make a neural network and train it 
Step 5 : check model accuracy and loss 
Step 6 : prediction using model 
Step 7 : saving the model 
Step 8 : loading the saved model
Step 9 : prediction using new model
